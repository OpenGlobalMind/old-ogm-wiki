## OGM Wiki Conventions

When creating a page, please put it into an appropriate top-level or sub-level directory.  If it's not obvious where to put a new page, or if you're using software that will automatically create pages, please point it into the `_new-pages` top-level directory.

When embedding images or adding other non-Markdown files, consider putting them in the `_attachments` top-level directory.
