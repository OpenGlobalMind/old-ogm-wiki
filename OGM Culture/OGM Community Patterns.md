# OGM Community Patterns

## Coalescing a New Community
1. a couple of people in conversation realize that there is a latent community of practice that could come together
1. a mattermost channel is created with a few obvious initial participants
1. additional participants continue to join the channel, either from invites (direct and indirect), or just because the name is attractive
1. the participants keep adding content and discussion they think is relevant to the topic
1. at some point, critical mass is achieved, and the participants deeper and richer interactions both here and elsewhere (zoom calls, working sessions, etc.)
