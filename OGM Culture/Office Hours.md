# Office Hours

Stacey and Pete are starting an experiment of having "office hours", regular times each week that you can come to talk about with them about whatever.

Ping [Stacey](27openheart@gmail.com) or [Pete](kaminski@istori.com) if you'd like to set up your own office hours and have them included here.
