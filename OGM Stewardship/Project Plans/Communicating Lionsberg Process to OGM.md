# Communicating Lionsberg Process to OGM

(initial draft from **OGM Stewardship Council, 2021-03-17** notes)

next work session(s):
- 2 hours on Wednesday, 3/30 at 07:00 PT on Jerry's zoom; see [[OGM Stewards chat channel]]
	- when done, `@channel` to Stewards channel


first communication is to stewards channel, and is about being in the stewards channel -- prefacing


## Timeline



ASAP - start somewhere communicating to wider OGM community - 

Goals:

- transparency
- wholism
- absorbing and integrating good suggestions
- open, honest
- we've been working hard

languaging:

- exploring these things
- differentiate between "OGM Foundation" and "OGM community"
  - (is it two things? more things? does it have fractal and/or holographic nature?)
  - what are the relationships between the different OGMs?
- why Lionsberg?
  - leverage of larger community
  - approaching possibility of financing / funding for OGM goals
  - Steward Ownership relative to other models (platform cooperative, FairShares, etc.)
	  - They're not mutually exclusive (not either/or)

what we might communicate / maybe not all at once

what media and method do we use to communicate
- Google Slides presentation, then record it and share it? (current fav)
- MaSVF wiki pages, which we share live in a pop-up OGM call?

include FAQs, anticipated questions/resistance and have answers laid out before communicating

phase 1:

- heads up - lionsberg and money in the mix, conversations in progress, intensifying in focus and coherence
- alignment process happened - it was reasonably awesome
- stewards have just agreed to move forward

phase 2:

- now we are in the process of organizing the MOU/ SOW

where, when and how:
email to list / forum / mattermost
  - special meeting (or two) (tbd)
- follow-up call(s) with OGM members at large (tbd)
  - include FAQs, anticipated questions/resistance and have answers laid out in Communication Plan
