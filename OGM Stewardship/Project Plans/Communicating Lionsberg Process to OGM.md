# Communicating Lionsberg Process to OGM

(initial draft from **OGM Stewardship Council, 2021-03-17** notes)



ASAP - start somewhere communicating to wider OGM community - 

Goals:

- transparency
- wholism

languaging:

- exploring these things
- differentiate between "OGM Foundation" and "OGM community"
  - (is it two things? more things? does it have fractal and/or holographic nature?)
  - what are the relationships between the different OGMs?
- why Lionsberg?
  - leverage of larger community
  - approaching possibility of financing / funding for OGM goals

what we might communicate / maybe not all at once

what media and method do we use to communicate

include FAQs, anticipated questions/resistance and have answers laid out before communicating

phase 1:

- heads up - lionsberg and money in the mix, conversations in progress, intensifying in focus and coherence
- alignment process happened - it was reasonably awesome
- stewards have just agreed to move forward

phase 2:

- now we are in the process of organizing the MOU/ SOW

where:
a) mailing list, 
b) discourse forum, 
c) mattermost
