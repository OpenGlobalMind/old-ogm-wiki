## Due Diligence Around Lionsberg

## Follow-On Action Items / Plans

- Discuss who/how many are quorum for which classes of decisions, for when we need to make definite decisions, potentially more frequently than once per week. (Bootstrap governance / Governance Plan)
- Start OGM Program/Project Management Tool Decision Plan (between MaSVF, Notion, Airtable, + whatever else).
- Decide how/when to move most Stewardship operations back into the public channels rather than Inner Circle.
