# Appendix C: Generative Commons Agreement

As with other Appendices to this Memorandum of Understanding between OGM Bootstrap and Lionsberg, the ideas here express our early alignment and understanding, and will be the subject of our attention so that they may be improved, deepened and propagated in ways that are useful to society as a whole. This is a satisfactory starting point. 

This Appendix was born in a discussion about Intellectual Property rights and responsibilities, as a way to free OGM from the traditional language of IP clauses, which all too often involve ownership and exclusion, at the expense of stewardship and inclusion. 

More specifically, what happens when participants who want to protect their ideas mix with a Commons that favors openness? 

Also, how can resources best be made open so that they are protected from today's overly enthusiastic Intellectual Property laws, as well as aggressive IP hoarders?

To that end, we make the following statements.

Our intent is to nurture many Commons, particularly the (many) Information Commons. 

[Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) has done an excellent job of wrapping copyright terms in easily implemented ways, such as CC: BY. We include their work here by reference. 

Our normal process includes recording Zoom calls, taking copious notes during those calls, and posting those materials publicly online. Anyone who wants to protect their ideas should not share them in our fora, and should mention in conversations that their ideas are "off the record," so to speak. 

Our preferred goal is to find our way to business models that support enriching the Commons while supporting profitable businesses. Many Open Source projects are great examples of this, coupling a foundation responsible for the code with a company that customizes that code for paying clients. We suspect there are many interesting, parallel arrangements that we will help elaborate and share.

extra words: 

For example, current US copyright law, starting from the [Copyright Act of 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976), states that all works "fixed in a tangible medium" are automatically under copyright, a huge shift. That means that if OGM and its allied organizations simply publish to the public domain, the works may in fact
