# OGM Stewardship Jerry + Pete, 2021-03-28

## Agenda
- Discuss who/how many are quorum for which classes of decisions, for when we need to make definite decisions, potentially more frequently than once per week. (Bootstrap governance / Governance Plan)
- Start Communication Plan (to OGM members about OGM-Lionsberg).
- Start OGM Program/Project Management Tool Decision Plan (between MaSVF, Notion, Airtable, + whatever else).
- Decide how/when to move most Stewardship operations back into the public channels rather than Inner Circle.
- Review need for other plans, such as Operational Plan for Launch Sprint.
- Discuss need for additional Stewardship meetings (like this one), and scheduling them better.
- Wrap the meeting and items above for presentation and review on Tuesday's meeting.
- Work (or not) on merging in MoU edits
