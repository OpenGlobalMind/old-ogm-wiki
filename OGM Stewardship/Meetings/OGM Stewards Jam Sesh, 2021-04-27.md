## Notes

### Wiki Governance

- good wiki structure = good governance
- clarity of definitions

## References / Resources

- [The LAO: A For\-Profit, Limited Liability Autonomous Organization](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c)
    - Not sure if this is the "LAO" David refers to, but it's a good short history of The DAO, and an explanation of The LAO.  It bears a compare/contrast between the LAO structure and the Lionsberg structure.

## Handling Scale; Decentralization

- How to achieve consensus in a large group of people? (i.e., scale)
- Idea: decentralized federation of focused sovereigns
    - Federation = agreements, commitments, promises between sovereigns.
    - Each sovereign has its own, focused, vision/mission/values around a center of gravity.
    - Sovereigns can be service providers and clients to each other.
    - This is called federated micro-publics in GaiaFests "minimal viable governance model".
        - therefore, "sovereign" = "micro-publics"
- Observations
    - Amorphousness is good.
    - Focus is good.
    - Decentralization and federation provide both amorphousness and focus.
- Tools
    - Scaling while preserving the quality of rich deliberation requires tool support.

## Proposal to Collaborate on Governance Issues

- not a governance model per se, rather a time scale
- short-term process for funding
- (a flotilla of sovereigns/micro-publics forming and doing work that might be, could be hundreds of them)
- mid-term (Nov 21 / June 22), really good process for constitution OGM, GaiaFest
    - 10-15 membership meetings would be needed for good process

"revenue stream" -> "value stream" (where "value" == something that i or someone really care about, a measurable value, value creation)

flotilla
- practical, federation
- each sovereign is a legal entity, with its own form
- an ecosystem of legal entities

quotes
- test: if it's a minimal step, are you ready to burn it down and build something else?
- "'subset of the flotilla' is misleading"
- "governance is about managing conflict"
- "pace matching"
- where do you incorporate the law
- [[Legislative Theatre]]
- "evolution needs something to work with"

For GaiaFest I need to start a governance conversation leading to a constitution for the project that is able to decide about budget and resource allocation in the light of rich and meaningful deliberations about environmental values.

The requirements for these discussions I believe are identical to the OGM stewardship deliberations in the Stewards channel. But I will take a very different approach.

The difference of approach is mainly a difference in structure. That is, I believe in having structure lead openness, rather than look for structure simply to emerge from openness (at least in the time scale needed for GaiaFest). 

This timescale requires a rich detailed human-centred governance, with some degree of legal participation across global jurisdictions and a legal DAO (LAO) like component presented on the world stage in November (at COP26). It also needs to be functional enough in order to organise next years festival - so by November it needs to be up and working.

To that end I hope to start some structural work around rich governance from a legal and technical perspective starting this week, with the aim of presenting a work program in 6 weeks time on World Environment Day.

This will be:

1) A technical work group open to people who are motivated to work on the legal-tech aspects that will need to be in place prior to the involvement of a demos (public).
2) GaiaFest requires an ambitious involvement of diverse stakeholders. Those who will actually make the decisions. This means building micro-publics and supporting their deliberations with the infrastructure we have built in 1) above.

My proposal (discussed with Jerry and Pete) is that we combine forces on these Governance issues, and adopt a similar timescale.

That is, I propose that whatever stewardship proposal OGM adopts is both sped up and slowed down. 

First, OGM should adopt a pragmatic and simple stewardship model that fits any fiscal needs it may have until November. 

Second, it should take the time between now and November to deliberate its stewardship needs in detail. 

Lastly, OGM should propose a structure to its members and formally adopt a stewardship model after the November public presentation.

The adoption of a timescale like this would allow such possibilities as:

1) We pool legal-tech expertise and build a common legal-tech platform to support both organisations.
2) We run common governance workshops around GaiaFest, and learn from this thought experiment together and seek to apply lessons learned to OGM.
